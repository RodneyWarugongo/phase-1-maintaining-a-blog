            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Rodney, and I'm the creator of "Blog with Rodney". As of 10:59 AM EAT on Monday, September 22, 2025, I've been passionate about sharing my thoughts and experiences through writing. This blog is a space where I explore various topics, from technology to personal growth.</p>
            <p>I have a background in web development and enjoy experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build sites like this one. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading novels, playing basketball, or brainstorming my next plan.</p>
            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>This journey began as a personal project to document my learning and connect with others. I'm excited to continue growing this space and hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing!</p>
